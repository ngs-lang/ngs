  NGS is a unique combination of select features borrowed from other languages and original features. NGS was built from the ground up focusing on daily systems engineering tasks.
  One way to think about NGS is bash plus data structures plus better syntax and error handling.
  Scripting AWS is much easier with NGS, there is a Declarative Primitives style library for that.
